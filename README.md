# Cat Adoption SPA
## Project Overview
- This is a Single Page Application (SPA) for adopting cats. Users can browse a list of adorable cats available for adoption, view their details, and adopt them. Upon adoption, the cat is removed from the list. 
- In the future, the web app should seamlessly allow the addition of new cats, whether they are born within the SPA, rescued as strays from the streets, or donated by well-wishers.
The "Adopt" button functions as a selling action, removing the selected cat from the list and redirecting the user to a page where they can enter their adoption details and complete the required payment for the cat.


## Features
- Fetches cat data dynamically from a public API.  
- Displays cat images, names, and adoption statuses.  
  - Includes additional details like health condition, age, etc.(future to be added features)  
- Users can adopt a cat by clicking a button, which removes it from the list.(should take the user to adoptors page to input their details and pay required fee to adopt the cat)
- A polished and responsive UI using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
- Uses asynchronous API requests to fetch and update cat data.
