# Cat Adoption SPA
## Project Overview
- This is a Single Page Application (SPA) for adopting cats. Users can browse a list of adorable cats available for adoption, view their details, and adopt them. Upon adoption, the cat is moved to cart basket. 
- In the future, the web app should seamlessly allow the addition of new cats, whether they are born within the SPA, rescued as strays from the streets, or donated by well-wishers.
The "Adopt" button functions as a selling action, adding the selected cat to the cart. The cat can either be returned to the SPA from the cart or dispatched to the adopter. Once the cat is removed from the SPA and the cart, it is deleted from the list.


## Features
- Fetches cat data dynamically from a public API.  
- Displays cat images, names, and adoption statuses.  
  - Includes additional details like health condition, age, etc.(future to be added features)  
- Users can adopt a cat by clicking a button, which removes it from the list.(should take the user to adoptors page to input their details and pay required fee to adopt the cat)
- A polished and responsive UI using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
- Uses asynchronous API requests to fetch and update cat data.
